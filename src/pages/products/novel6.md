title: Hamlet
description: >-
  Hamlet is Shakespeare's most popular, and most puzzling, play. It follows the
  form of a "revenge tragedy," in which the hero, Hamlet, seeks vengeance
  against his father's murderer, his uncle Claudius, now the king of Denmark.
  Much of its fascination, however, lies in its uncertainties.
